 or 
	satisfies the duty to minimize Harm by a value at least 1 more  
 or 
	satisfies the duty to minimize Non-Interaction by a value at least 1 more  
 or 
	does not violate the duty to minimize Harm by a value greater than 3 more and
	satisfies the duty to maximize autonomy by a value at least 1 more
